                        Book Nook is a cozy corner designed for book lovers who want to keep an organized and accessible record of their books. The idea comes from my personal experience as a reader and the need to manage my personal library in a more comfortable and visually pleasant way.

                        I focused on maintaining a clean and minimalist design because I believe that an intuitive navigation experience is key to engaging the user. A good design can make the difference between abandoning an app or turning it into a space you always want to return to.
